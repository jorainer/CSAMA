# Metabolomics?

--

- Large-scale study of small molecules (metabolites) in a system (cell, tissue,
  organism).

- Metabolites: intermediates and products of cellular processes.

--

- Metabolome?
  - **Genome**: what can happen.
  - **Transcriptome**: what appears to be happening.
  - **Proteome**: what makes it happen.
  - **Metabolome**: what actually happened.

--

- Metabolome influenced by genetic **and** environmental factors.

---

## This is some random R test.

- Some R code doing...
```{r}
a <- 4
a
```
